Using Quantum Machine Learning to enhance Classification and Regression Machine Learning Models

In this era of big data and machine learning, a huge
quantity of data in the magnitude of trillions is processed every
day, to make inferences. It is incumbent upon us to process this
large aggregate of data for making precise and logical decisions.
In order to process such a huge amount of data, large industry-
grade components are required, which are very expensive and
inaccessible to the masses. Thus, we are looking into the realm
of Quantum Computers for better optimization of machine
learning models. In this paper, we discuss how, classification and
regression machine learning models can be optimized and made
efficient by using quantum machine layer.
